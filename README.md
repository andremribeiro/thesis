# Cooperative 3D Exploration using Distributed Multi-UAV Teams

This repository contains the code for my thesis, which involves an exploration algorithm tested using the MRS UAV simulator, Octomap mapping, MRS Path Planner, and the Mean Shift Clustering algorithm.

## Overview

- MRS UAV Simulator: Used to test the exploration algorithm in a simulated environment.
- Octomap Mapping: Creates a 3D map of the environment.
- MRS Path Planner: Plans the UAV's path.
- Mean Shift Clustering: Optimizes the exploration by clustering data points.
